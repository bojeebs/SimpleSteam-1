# <Simple-Steam>

## Description
 This project is a Steam clone. We decided to make a straightforward wishlist for users to add games from any genre to a list. This project was created to demonstrate our knowledge of PERN Stack(PostgreSQL, Express, React, Node.js) and use of CRUD. 


## Planning
We used figma for our wireframe to design website layout and planned out associations and models on a ERD. Listed below:
